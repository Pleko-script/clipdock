ClipDock keeps reusable editing assets out of scattered folders and inside one visual, searchable library. Hover to preview an effect, press `Space` for a larger contextual preview, then drag the unchanged source file directly into your editor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ClipDock manages normal video and audio files—not plugins, presets, templates, MOGRTs, installers, or image sequences. It never modifies your source media and does not control your editor's timeline.

## Why ClipDock?

Effect libraries grow quickly. Finding one transition or sound often means opening folders, guessing from filenames, and previewing files one by one. ClipDock turns that folder archive into a focused editing tool:

- **See the effect before using it.** Transitions and overlays are rendered against local demo scenes; sounds get cached waveforms.
- **Stay inside your existing workflow.** Drag one or multiple real media files into DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, or another editor.
- **Organize without touching disk.** Packs, Collections, tags, and favorites live in ClipDock while source files stay where they are.
- **Work without an account.** Everything—including metadata, search, and generated previews—runs locally.

## Features

|              | Feature                   | What it does                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Browse**   | Virtualized asset grid    | Keeps large libraries responsive while showing full-bleed thumbnails.                                       |
| **Preview**  | Contextual playback       | Shows transitions between demo clips, overlays over a neutral scene, and sounds as waveforms.               |
| **Find**     | Search and filters        | Searches filenames, packs, folders, and tags; filters by asset type, format, pack, Collection, or favorite. |
| **Reuse**    | Recently and most used    | Records successful local drags so proven assets are easy to find again.                                    |
| **Organize** | Packs and Collections     | Treats each imported folder as a pack and its subfolders as categories. Collections never move files.       |
| **Classify** | Automatic asset detection | Recognizes common transition, overlay, and sound naming patterns; every result remains editable.            |
| **Inspect**  | Media metadata            | Reads duration, resolution, FPS, codecs, audio properties, and detectable alpha channels with FFprobe.      |
| **Trim**     | Non-destructive In / Out  | Prepares a frame-accurate video range for drag-and-drop without changing the source file.                   |
| **Rotate**   | Quarter-turn video edits  | Rotates clips left or right in 90° steps and prepares the result for native drag-and-drop.                  |
| **Listen**   | Preview volume            | Plays available clip audio with a persistent volume slider and mute control.                                |
| **Language** | Deutsch / English         | Switches the complete interface instantly and remembers the local preference.                               |
| **Deliver**  | Native multi-file drag    | Resolves and validates real local paths in Electron's main process before starting the OS drag.             |
| **Recover**  | Missing-media relink      | Points a moved pack at a new root while preserving favorites, tags, and Collections.                        |

## Workflow

### 1. Add a pack

Choose **Add Pack** and select a folder containing effects. The selected folder becomes one pack; its subfolders become browsable categories.

### 2. Find and preview

ClipDock scans supported media, stores metadata first, and generates previews in the background. Search, filter, favorite, or group assets into Collections. Hover a card for a quick preview or press `Space` for Quick Look.

### 3. Drag into the edit

For a video, open the centered editor above the asset grid to set optional **In** and **Out** points or rotate the frame in 90° steps. Organizing controls stay visible on the left and file details on the right, without an internal editor scrollbar. The square `contain` preview keeps portrait and landscape footage fully visible. When the source has audio, the preview volume and mute controls apply immediately and persist locally. ClipDock renders the edit into its local cache; opaque footage becomes a high-quality H.264 MP4 and alpha footage becomes a ProRes 4444 MOV. Resetting returns the card to its original file.

Drag a card—or a multi-selection—into your editor. Cards with a prepared range or rotation drag the cached result; all other cards drag their original media:

| Asset          | Typical timeline placement         | Context preview                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Transition** | Between two normal video clips     | Demo A → transition clip → Demo B         |
| **Overlay**    | On a video track above the footage | Composited over a generated neutral scene |
| **Sound**      | On an audio track                  | Waveform with original audio playback     |

For a black-background overlay, use a **Screen/Add** blend mode in the editor. Alpha-capable media is marked automatically when FFprobe can detect it.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the currently tested platform
- [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- Git

### Run in development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pleko-script/clipdock.git
cd clipdock
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build the Windows app

```bash
npm run build:win
```

To verify a local checkout before contributing:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

## Supported media

| Type  | Extensions                                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Video | `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mxf`, `.m4v`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.webm`, `.mpg`, `.mpeg`, `.ts`, `.mts`, `.m2ts` |
| Audio | `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.aac`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.ogg`                                                  |

Format support does not guarantee that every codec inside a container is accepted by every editing application. ClipDock distinguishes **Verified**, **Expected**, and **Unsupported** compatibility instead of claiming universal support.

## Local by design

ClipDock is deliberately offline and account-free:

- Source files are referenced in place and are **never moved, modified, or deleted**.
- SQLite data, generated previews, and non-destructive trimmed copies stay under Electron's local `userData/clipdock-library` directory.
- There is no cloud synchronization, telemetry, remote logging, or AI generation.
- The renderer has no direct file-system access. SQLite, FFmpeg, FFprobe, dialogs, shell actions, and native drag operations stay behind a typed preload bridge in the main process.
- Context isolation, renderer sandboxing, disabled Node integration, and a constrained `clipdock-media://` protocol reduce the renderer's privileges.

## Architecture

```text
React renderer
  └─ typed preload API
      └─ Electron main process
          ├─ SQLite asset store and search
          ├─ pack scanner and metadata analysis
          ├─ persistent FFmpeg preview queue (max. 2 jobs)
          └─ validated native file drag
```

The interface uses React and TanStack Virtual. Electron owns all privileged operations. SQLite stores packs, assets, Collections, tags, and persistent preview jobs. FFprobe analyzes media; FFmpeg creates silent H.264 context previews, WebP thumbnails, and sound waveforms.

The visual and interaction system is documented in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md).

## Platform support

| Platform / target  | Status                                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 10/11      | Primary development platform                                               |
| DaVinci Resolve    | Native file drag implemented; practical format matrix still being expanded |
| Adobe Premiere Pro | Native file drag implemented; practical format matrix still being expanded |
| macOS / Linux      | Build scripts exist, but these platforms are not currently validated       |

Long paths, spaces, and Unicode filenames are preserved by the native drag path. If an editor rejects a codec, transcode the source to a format supported by that editor; ClipDock intentionally does not modify it for you.

## Project status

ClipDock is an early-stage local-first project. The current focus is a reliable Windows workflow for reusable transitions, overlays, and sounds.

Potential next steps:

- Custom preview backgrounds
- Better detection of black-background Screen/Add overlays
- Exact duplicate and similar-effect detection
- Portable pack metadata sidecars
- A larger manually verified Resolve/Premiere compatibility matrix

Marketplace features, accounts, cloud sync, presets, templates, and editor plugins are intentionally out of scope.

## Contributing
